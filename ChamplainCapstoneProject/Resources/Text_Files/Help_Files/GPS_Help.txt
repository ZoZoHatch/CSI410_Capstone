[Description]
The GPS component tracks the location and direction
of the Rover in the world.
 
[Functionality]
GPS only takes one number a time, and discards any extra numbers
 
1 -> Print Rover location to terminal
2 -> Print Rover direction to terminal
3 -> Print both location and direction
4 -> Toggle automatically printing location
    when the rover moves
5 -> Toggle automatically printing direction
    when the rover turns
6-> Toggle printing only when the rover is finished moving
7 -> Toggle printing to the console
	(GPS will still update the Mini-Map)	
 
9 -> Print the configuration of the GPS
 
The GPS's precision is determined by how much power it has.
    More power == More precision
