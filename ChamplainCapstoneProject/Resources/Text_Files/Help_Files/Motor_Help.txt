[Name]
Motor
 
[Description]
The Motor component moves the Rover through the world.
 
[Functionality]
Motor processes commands in one(1) character chunks.
 
8 -> forward    2 -> backward
4 -> turn left  6 -> trun right
7 -> fwd left   1 -> bck left
9 -> fwd right  3 -> bck right
 
./5 -> break/wait
 
Commands are added to a queue and processed sequentially.
 
Allocating more power to the rover increases the speed at which it moves
