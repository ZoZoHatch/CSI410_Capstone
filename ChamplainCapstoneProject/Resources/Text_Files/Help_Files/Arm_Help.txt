[Description]
The Arm component is used for positioning the Collector component
for sample collection.
 
[Functionality]
Arm processes commands in one(1) character chunks.
 
Controls for Collector joint:
7 -> rotate counter-clockwise
8 -> get joints current angle
9 -> rotate clockwise
 
Controls for center joint:
4 -> rotate counter-clockwise
5 -> get joints current angle
6 -> rotate clockwise
 
Controls for Rover joint:
1 -> rotate counter-clockwise
2 -> get joints current angle
3 -> rotate clockwise
 
Commands are added to a queue and processed sequentially.
 
Arm has a high minimum power requirement, but
once that requirement is met it works optimally.
 
Arm doesn't benifit from increasing the power
beyond the minimum.
